# Messeger
Messeger is a headless Node application that lets you log in, read and send messages using the Facebook Messenger API.

## Note before use
Any account used with this application risks getting suspended or banned by Facebook.

## How to use
```Node app.js -u <username> -p <password> -m <message> -r <reciptientId>```
Reciptient id is a 64-bit integer value that can be aquired by logging in to an Messenger account in a browser and check the URL.
